Cucumber-style syntax

Title: Student attempts to login to the system

As a user
I want log in to the system
So that I can start playing the word-recognition games

Scenarios:

Scenario 1: User enters correct username and password
Given the user has loaded up the app 
And the login screen has been launched
And the user's username and password exist in the database
When a user enters a username and the correct password into the login fields 
Then the system validates the username and firstname 
And logins the player successfully
And the system will load up the home page
And the user's name will be displayed in the appropriate position on the home page (good idea?)

Scenario 2: User enters incorrect username and password
Given the user has loaded up the app 
And the login screen has been launched
And the user's username and password exist in the database
When a user enters a different username and an incorrect password into the login fields 
Then the system does not validate the username and firstname 
And the system prevents the user from logging in
And the system alerts the user that he or she has entered an invalid username and / or invalid password

Scenario 3: The user does not have a username and password in the system
Given the user has loaded up the appAnd the login screen has been launched
And a username and password do not exist for the user in the database
When a user enters a username and a password into the login fields 
Then the system does not validate the username and firstname 
And the system prevents the user from logging in
And the system alerts the user that he or she has entered an invalid username and / or invalid password

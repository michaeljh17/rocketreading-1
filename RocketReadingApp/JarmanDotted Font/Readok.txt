 Using the Jarman Font

 Strictly speaking this is not a Font but a simulation of the Christopher
 Jarman cursive handwriting as seen in the handwriting scheme for schools,
 "The Development of Handwriting Skills" by Christopher Jarman now published by

	The National Association for Primary Education (NAPE)
	University of Leicester
	Moulton College
	Moulton
	Northampton UK
	NN37RR
	Tel: 01604 647646
	email: nationaloffice@nape.org.uk     

 The intention is for teachers and pupils to be able to write out their own
 copy sheets for handwriting practice using their own words, to supplement
 the Scheme.

 As an  outline font however, it will load into any suitable
 program and can be used to produce documents  with a hand-written appearance
 when required.


 Look at the font Jardotty to help with this too!
